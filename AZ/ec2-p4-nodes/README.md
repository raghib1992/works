### Would you be able to get the following information: 
1) What jobs are running on the p4 reserved instances, e.g. the manifest.
2) What the resources used and command run is for those jobs.
3) Monitoring data for the last month (or further if available).
4) From the above, could you give me your professional opinion about the days the nodes have been active and in use vs days idle for the last month (or whatever the monitoring period is).
