ECS cluster are logical grouping of ec2 instance

1. You need a ecs cluster
2. setup iam
3. vpc
4. Create ECS Cluster (EC2 based)
- select the vpc 
- select the subnet
- Infrasucture
    * select Ec2
    * Create AutoScaling Group
    * Operating System 
    * Ec2 instance type
    * Desire Capacity 
    * SSh Keypair

5. Create ECS Cluster (fargate Based)
- select the vpc 
- select the subnet
- Infrasucture
    * select Fargate

6. Task defination
* Metadata in JSON format to tel ecs how to run a docker container
* Info Like 
    - Image name
    - port binging
    - memory and cpu reuired
    - env variable
    - Network Info
    - IAM Role
    - Logging Conf
    - Internet gateway

7. ECS service
* defien how many tasks should run and how they should be run 
* Ensure number of tasks desired is running across our fleet of ec2 instance
* They can be linked to Load Balaner if needed
* You can run tasks without service

8. ECS Task Placement Strategies
* This minimizes the number of instances in use (cost saving)
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "field": "memory",
        "type": "binpack"
    }
]

* Random
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "type": "random"
    }
]

* spread
"placementStrategy": [
    {
        "field": "attribute:ecs.availability-zone",
        "type": "spread"
    }
]
* distinctInstance
* memberOf


9. Netwroking Mode
* none -no ext connectivity
- Bridge (default)

- Host

- AWS VPC (Required for Fargate)
